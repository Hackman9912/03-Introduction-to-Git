You can create a repository under your **username **or under an **organization**. For now just enter a Respository name and a Description. The README file can be created with your project. It's optional and can be added later if necessary. Mostly, if you're creating a new repo you'll want to initialize it with a README.  If you already have a repo you're wanting to upload you can skip this step.
