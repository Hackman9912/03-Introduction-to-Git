You can create a repository under your **username **or under a **group**. For now just enter a Respository name and a Description under the** Blank project** tab.

Initializing a new repository will look like this:

\(copy url for project:  [https://gitlab.com/user-name1/test.git\](https://gitlab.com/user-name1/test.git\)\)

The README file can be created with your project. It's optional and can be added later if necessary. Mostly, if you're creating a new repo you'll want to initialize it with a README.  If you already have a repo you're wanting to upload you can skip this step. The README can be used in various ways, but it will allow you and others to clone the project immediately.
