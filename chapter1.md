# Introduction to GitHub

**Git: **is a _distributed_ version control system, which means that everyone working with a project in Git has a copy of the full history of the project, not just the current state of the files.

**Version Control: **A _version control system_ is a piece of software designed to keep track of the changes made to files over time.

_**GitHub:**_ is a platform where you can upload a copy of your Git repository \(often shortened to _repo_\), hosted either on GitHub.com, by your company on a cloud provider, etc...  It also allows you to collaborate much more easily with other people on your projects by providing a centralized location to share the repository, a web-based interface to view it, and features like _forking_, _Pull Requests_, _Issues_, _Projects_, and _GitHub Wikis_ that allow you to specify, discuss, and review changes with your team more effectively.
