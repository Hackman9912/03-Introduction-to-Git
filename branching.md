# Cloning and Branching

**Branching ** is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of the master repository as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

This diagram shows:

* The master branch
* A new branch called feature \(because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch\)
* The journey that feature takes before it’s merged into master
